# A Guide to Submitting Data and Associated Documentation to the CCHDO

:version: V1 2024-08-08

## Overview
This guide gives recommendations for scientists and groups submitting data to the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) at the University of California - San Diego (UCSD) Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
The CCHDO is a Data Assembly Center for high-quality hydrographic data - meaning vertical profile data from CTD, CTD/rosette, and bottle casts covering physical and chemical parameters - from GO-SHIP and related programs.
Any vertical profile data from CTD instruments and bottles may be submitted from any oceanographic region.
Additional GO-SHIP measurements, such as underway data and ADCP data, are not managed by CCHDO. 

These guidelines are recommendations and not requirements.
CCHDO has always and will continue to accept data as provided.
However, when resources are limited, data meeting submission guidelines will have priority for assembly into standard products.
Standardizing heterogeneous data is the time-limiting step of providing our standardized product and the CCHDO can be at its most efficient when incoming data meet standards.
For an abridged version of data submission guidelines, please refer to the following [document][submission_summary].

For further information about the CCHDO and its holdings, please see: [http://cchdo.ucsd.edu](http://cchdo.ucsd.edu).

The CCHDO highly encourages anyone, especially first time submitters, to send us an email if they have any questions. We are very happy to help! Email us at [cchdo@ucsd.edu][cchdo_email]

### Overview of  Steps for Data Submission

1. **Send a cruise plan to the CCHDO (Optional)**

   Before a CTD/hydrographic cruise takes place, it is useful for the scientists planning the cruise to contact the CCHDO (via email to [cchdo@ucsd.edu][cchdo_email]) to provide a cruise plan and discuss data timing and any special considerations.
   Data licensing should be considered before the cruise takes place. 
1. **Apply and document appropriate sampling and analytic protocols at sea (Essential)**

   The core of reference-quality CTD/hydrographic/tracer work lies in the application *and documentation* of appropriate methodology. Review recommendations on creating unique identifiers for cruise, station, cast, and samples (see [ref](todo_ref)) in advance, to implement while at sea.

1. Submit data and documentation to the CCHDO (Essential).

   The CCHDO *strongly* recommends that data originators submit their data using one of three formats: WHP-Exchange, CSV with suggested information, or NetCDF with suggested information; see the [Format](todo_ref) section for more details.

   The following minimum required ancillary information is requested in the data submission portal:

   1. Name and email address of person submitting the data
   2. Whether or not the data are public. CCHDO is intended as an open, public archive.
      Non-public data are only accepted under special circumstances and should be discussed in advance. 

   While programs such as GO-SHIP have specific timelines for data submission after a cruise (e.g. [https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/)), CCHDO accepts data at any time.
   Bottle data parameters from different measurement groups may be submitted together in a single file that has been compiled by the scientific team, or in separate files that will be combined by the CCHDO.
   Data updates that are submitted to the CCHDO following the same protocol as initial data submissions will be combined by the CCHDO into the dataset.
