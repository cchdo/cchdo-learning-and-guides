# Cruise Documentation

**Cruise Reports** are the primary cruise documentation and are provided on the cruise page when available. The CCHDO attempts to make other relevant documentation, especially if received in electronic form, available as well. This includes reports from investigators, overviews from data quality examination, copies of tables of information held by the CCHDO, etc.
