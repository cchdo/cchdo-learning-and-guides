# Scope of Data at CCHDO

:version: 2024-12-05

The CCHDO is the data repository for global GO-SHIP hydrographic (CTD and bottle) data.
GO-SHIP and GO-SHIP-associated cruises will have priority for accession.
In addition, the CCHDO welcomes, as resources allow, hydrographic data from any program meeting the following characteristics:

* Of [GO-SHIP](http://www.go-ship.org/HydroMan.html) or equivalent quality, as demonstrated by documented methods and quality flags
* Primarily ocean transects spanning coast-to-coast across an ocean basin, or a substantial section of an ocean basin, and intended as spatial surveys.
  Temporal surveys sampling a restricted location intensively for a substantial amount of time are also accepted but of lower priority.
* Primarily full-depth profiles
* Containing a majority of the [Level 1 GO-SHIP parameters](http://www.go-ship.org/DatReq.html)
* Open access. See the CCHDO [](data_license) page for further information

Data complying with the guidelines in [](../submitting_data/index) have priority for ingestion.
Note that the CCHDO program manages additional data not meeting these requirements under separate funding, e.g., for the Argo program.
